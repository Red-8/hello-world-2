# hello-world-2
Created for the express purpose of tutorial-following.
This text is essentially a placeholder- the Hello World program, while useful as a test, should not be taken in a fully serious manner. In fact, do not take the Hello World program at all, because I need it. Do not take Hello World less than 4 hours before/after operating heavy code-learning shenanigans for an excessive amount of time, or if you're branching or planning on branching.
